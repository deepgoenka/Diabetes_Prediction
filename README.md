# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes using a dataset containing various health-related features. Three different algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and RandomForest, are employed for classification tasks. The RandomForest algorithm, with an impressive accuracy of 99%, is chosen as the primary model for making predictions.

## Accuracy

The model accuracies are as follows:
- Logistic Regression: 96%
- Support Vector Machine: 95%
- RandomForest: 99%

The high accuracy of the RandomForest model makes it the preferred choice for predicting diabetes based on the given features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes health-related features extracted from individuals, with labels indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. The dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the performance of the prediction models.

## Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the models' effectiveness in diabetes prediction.

## Conclusion

The RandomForest algorithm emerges as the most effective model in predicting diabetes, achieving an outstanding accuracy of 99%. The robust performance of the model suggests its potential applicability in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights for early diabetes detection and intervention.
